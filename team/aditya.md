#  Music Recommendation - Aditya Sharma

### About me 
* 3rd year CS student interested in AI
* have a background in ML, would like to incorporate it into our project!
* enjoy learning and working with others

### Introduction
Creating an application which can recommend music based on features like:
1. Genre 
2. Artist 
3. Movies
4. Beats
5. Instruments

### Dataset
I found an existing dataset on kaggle: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vatsalmavani/music-recommendation-system-using-spotify-dataset).
I think we can use this dataset and train a naive Machine Learning Model and see how well it can perform and explore other datasets as well.

* More complicated idea: We can analyze the wave patterns for a song and overlay it with another song. The waves that match most closely could mean similar sounding music.

### Machine Learning
* We can use clustering algorithm such as KMeans to find similar songs

##### Riffusion
* [Riffusion](https://www.riffusion.com/about) is a text-to-audio AI model which can generate audio based on text.
* We could implement this directly or a variation of it.

##### Google Guess the song
* With [Guess the Song](https://blog.google/products/search/hum-to-search/) you can hum a tune stuck on your mind and get the same of the song.

### Tech Stack
* React Web App 
* Python
* C++
