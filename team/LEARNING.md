# Learning Goals for this project by individual

| Name | Learning Goals | Experience Level with Tech Stacks |
|------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Aditya Sharma | - Do some digging into Datasets on Kaggle and determine the relevant features in the dataset (note down some important features)<br>- Read the SpotifyAPI and see which endpoints may be good <br>- Learn to send a GET Request using SpotifyAPI <br>- Learn how to use Python libraries (Read scikit-learn + pandas) | - Beginner with Python Django, Flask <br>- Relatively Familiar with ReactJS <br>- Familiar with Python overall<br>- Familiar with creating APIs <br>- Have experience with writing ML algorithms |
| Anmol Kapoor | distinguish between various datasets and determine what are the best features for what we need; how to create more optimal models (speed and efficiency); don’t want a model that is precise but takes forever, but also don’t want a model that just random and takes a millisecond | very familiar with python; familiar to some extent in Django and FastAPI, familiar with Flask, have some experience creating ML/DL algorithms and getting access to computing devices. Not too familiar with ReactJS/nodejs, but can write HTML/CSS/JS

| Ian Lai | - Learn Flask/Django/FastAPI (whichever one seems to better help with our MVP) <br>Learn about the python libraries needed for the project <br>Learn more about ReactJS | - Familiar with python overall as a language but unfamiliar with ML libraries. A little bit of experience with data science libraries such as numpy. <br>- Familiar with ReactJS and testing on it (unit and mutation). <br>- Unfamiliar with Django/Flask/FastAPI <br>- Have a little bit of experience with setting up github actions <br>- Unfamiliar with Spotify API |
| Parsa Hafezi | - Learn github branch management <br>- Learn about API <br> - Spotify API <br>- Crash course react basics | - Familiar with Python <br>- Familiar with Pytorch, sklearn and numpy <br>- Experience with ML algorithms |
