## Action item


* a goal: Improve our organization and efficiency.

## Optional


Start:
- Getting things done before our meetings
- Assigning ourselves to issues on our own. 
- Have an idea for what you’re going to code
- We need to be more explicit. 
- Reserving meetings for bigger issues.
- Have a scribe assigned before the meetings. 
- Writing actual high level organized tests for every new feature we make available.
- Writing tests retroactively for stuff we put out in the MVP.
- Breaking up larger features into smaller bits
- Getting one issue finished per week. 
- Splitting up into smaller groups based on the issues we’re working on, like frontend/backend 
- Writing more descriptive PRs, i.e. include a screenshot of what the markdown would look like, or what the new frontend would look like.




Stop: 
- Sending PRs with small errors like markdown formatting.
- Sending PRs with HUGE code review requirements, 
- Pushing code without tests associated with it.
- Not having an issue assigned every week.




Continue:
- Documenting code, working on the readme.
- Weekly meetings to help coordinate our tasks. 
- Communicating. 
- Creating issues as we find them. 
- Sending PRs without descriptions. 
- Asking for help when we need it. 






## Outcomes


For our goal this week, we want to improve our organization and get a huge portion of our database module complete. Our team implemented some of these changes right away. We had our scribe for lecture 12 assigned and ready for the day's task. Some of our members got to work on the database and got a ton of progress done. Their work is sitting in review right now awaiting in depth review. We still need to implement higher level testing and be more clear on what we want for our database. 


## Retro Assessment


We used the Start-Stop-Continue template for this retro. We were already familiar with it, so doing it again was a good idea. I believe we showed improvement when we implemented it in our first retro so it's proven to work for our group.
  
It went as well as I'd expected. Everyone got to say their piece and we had discussions about what we want to change. It turned out that the group had similar issues, so knowing that others shared those issues was good for the team. We plan on implementing changes based on our collective feedback. 
  
For the next retro I would say come prepared with issues that take more than just a conversation to fix. Communication is key but so is candor. We need to know when to bring issues up and when we should save them for a messaging board. We had a lot of issues brought up which was nice, but it came off as issues being held back and finally let go. If we have our major issues saved for the retros, we'd have an easier time doing retros.
