## Retro Assessment

* For this retro we continued using the start stop continue process

* We solved numerous issues this retro.  The first problem the team focused on was effective use our remaining time. The inefficiencies that we tried to resolve include: some members were spending more time testing than writing production code; holding meeting that lasted over an hour; and letting PR sit on github.  The second issue was addressing remaining question about task prioritization from our last team meeting. 


* My advice is to ask more open ended questions from your team after each member share their section (start, stop, continue) to get the conversation flowing about issues the team can resolve for next sprint.
