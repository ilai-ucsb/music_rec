# Team Norms
- Everyone needs to show up to meetings. If not able to, has to notify the team beforehand.
- Every pull request has to be reviewed by at least 2 others in the group. Notify the team on the slack when a PR is created.
- Make sure each feature has a test created for it before creating a PR.
