# Sprint Planning: (01/25/23)
## Music Recommendation
Mentors: Mateo/Matthew

# Discussion: 
## What should our MVP look like?

MVP (bare-bones of the project)

MVP, a simple music recommendation site. User enters a genre, we give them songs in that genre. 

Simple as possible recommendation engine, functioning
Recommend a random song
Ex: create a hash table where we have songs

MVP:
- INPUT: GENRE NAME
- OUTPUT: [List of Songs Relevant to the Given Genre]

MVP ReactJS:
- Title Name “Music Recommender”
- Enter a genre in the search bar, see if they inputted a valid genre
- After user enters genre, song list page with table and songs
- About Project
- Credit section (teaching staff/devs)


MVP Backend:
- Define a set of API calls
    - for example: /hello → return a “HELLO WORLD” message
