# Lecture 3: Daily Standup (01/19/23)
# Daily Standup
## Music Recommendation
Mentors: Mateo/Matthew

## Agenda
- Daily Scrum (log a lec02.md document!)
- Further discussion on technologies
- Work on lab01 deliverables
- Work on your README and team/AGREEMENTS.md from last class
- Scrum: User Stories


#### Mauricio
- No progress
- I am going to continue working on looking at similar applications to see what problems we can expect to encounter
- No blockers

#### Anmol
- Yesterday, I set up the PRs for the notes for last Friday’s notes and last lecture’s notes. I also created another branch protection rule where doing a PR to any branch other than main requires 1 code review. There is still the requirement that we agreed upon earlier that merging a branch to main requires two code reviews. We can discuss the pros and cons of this after the daily stand-up.
- Today, I plan on merging in the branches if they are not already done. I also plan on sharing my responses to the homework assignment due today and potentially consider adding them to the NORMS.md
- Blockers include PR review if it has not been done already.

#### Francisco
- Brainstorming ideas for the app through user stories. Thanks to the homework, have a few ideas of what the webapp will be.
- Going to do a crash course on REACT this weekend to get a better understanding of what we're using, and crash coursing a Github group projects. Plan on contributing to the lab01.
- No blockers

#### Ian
- Did not do anything previous
- Today I will be working on the lect03.md notes and discuss with the team about the project.
- No blockers but we should probably decide how to work on the HelloWorld webapp

#### Aditya
- Went ahead and reviewed the PR’s for the notes. Had some comments/standards so that when we submit stuff in the future we can keep those in mind. (1) Add a title on the top of the notes, even though the file is called lect01.md we should write that in the top along with the date. (2) Render your markdown before submitting PR because something it doesn’t do what you intend it to do, for example bullet point list.
- I was brainstorming some ideas which I wrote down on the User Stories for the homework and I think after this round we should go around in the circle and talk briefly about what our vision of the project is going to be like and jot down some ideas.
- Lab01 is due tomorrow so we should decide how we will all make this, we all need an individual contribution PR in so one thing which we could do is add our names into the ReactJS app, “Hello NAME”

#### Parsa
- Review two methods of ml recommendor system. 1 we could use KNN. 2. we could use a CNN or MLP to predict if a user will like a song and just run enough songs through the net work until we find 5 songs the user will like.
- I will continue looking at different recommendor implementations
- no blockers

### Discussion

We decided that we would check in once a week on Wed. at 8pm on slack and do a zoom meeting if necessary.
We also discussed whether or not we want to keep our current technology or switch to a different one.
