 You earn these team points if you list in a new team/evaluation/USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md document 
 three things about your product that you would love to have user feedback on 
 (just to give example possibilities: user preference between two designs, an A/B study on the consequences
 of two designs, user satisfaction with a particular feature, user satisfaction with your overall current product, 
 but there are many more possibilities). The more specific you can be on these items, the better.
 This is just ideation - no need to have code ready to actually DO any of these evaluations (yet).
 The idea is that we will facilitate and help you prepare one of the evaluations you list in an organized UX session in week 10.
 
 
 User preference between two designs for our returned recommendations:

The intuitiveness of our site, ie how quickly someone can grasp the site and the recommendation. 

How well the recommendations actually are. Like how would the user rate the recommendations they recieve from the engine.
