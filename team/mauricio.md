# About me
Im a fourth year CS student who wants to build an interesting project.
I have experience with C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript and others.
Outside of school I enjoy working out and playing sports.

# Project Ideas
Something I think would be nice to implement would be the ability to select what type of music you want to explore. So if generally you are into country and want to explore a specific subset of the country genre, you have aspects of your favorite songs listed which you can select.
