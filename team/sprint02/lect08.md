### Discussion

- We discussed the MVP video 
  - Showing off the product to the intended audience
  - Who is our audience: Zoomers. Do they care? No. Don't dive too deep in the technical aspects
  - We decided to go with a non-technical audience 
  - IDEALLY everyone should have a part in the video 
  - One person talks about features of the MVP
  - We could go on a ZOOM call or have one person record a feature and send it to an editor
  - No more than two slides if we choose to do slides
  - Anmol started coming up with a script: 
  - Possibly have a user listening to a song, say they like this song, try to use spotify to find a song like it, not liking spotify's suggestions, and then using our site to find songs. Then someone says we could improve the reccomendation engine, clean up the UI...more stuff to come?
  -  We're gonna meetup tonight on ZOOM to record a demo
- We should update our UI to be more attractive
- Cleaned up our github REPO in prep for MVP delivery 
- In the future we should refactor for a server sided application
