# About Me
- I'm a 3rd year CS major
- Have a little experience in creating a webapp using react and springboot
- Mostly have experience in c++ and have learned a little bit about kotlin but not too much experience.

# Project Ideas
- Find some way to pull a good amount of songs so that we can store it in our database to start recommending music to other people.
- Let the users be able to rate a song (maybe multiple ratings based on different factors that can be combined into one overall rating that others will see).
- Let users be able to sort/recommend songs based on more specific topics than just a broad genre.
