# Problem Scenario

We brainstormed the problem scenario as a team and went around the group. Below is what each person discussed about.

Francisco
* Jack, age 20. Jack is getting tired of his daily playlist, he wants to listen to new artists but not too different from his current tastes. He uses our app and finds out that he actually really enjoys Tame Impala, now Jack is an avid listener of Tame Impala and his desire is fulfilled. Jack could just use Spotify’s music recommendation feature right now. However, Spotify isn’t outright showing users new artists. Users need to go out of their way in the Spotify app to find new artists. It’s contrived. We want to make it so simple a child could do it.

Mauricio
* Franklin, 25. Franklin wants to explore new genres of music that are similar to his existing music. Spotify does not allow for enough search filters. Franklin applies filters to his music search to allow him to specify what subgenre of music he is looking for. Franklin looks through the returned list and selects a few songs to add to his playlist.

Ian
* Robert Miles age 24. User would like to be able to be recommended songs that are similar to songs that they like to listen. User would like to list song based on genre or other factors. Robert uses the music recommendation webapp and discovers new songs that suits his taste in music.

Anmol
* Jake, the young teen, uses Spotify but does not like its recommendations. He spends 15 minutes a day poring through different playlists and songs until he finds the right one for him. He turns to our project to help automate that process. He has listened to a lot of songs and wants to hear songs similar in style and origin to one of his favorite songs (Gangnam Style). He turns to our project to help him find other K-POP songs. He wants to create a playlist of songs that he would like. He turns to our project to devise a playlist that is compatible with his interests and taste in music. He also wants to listen to all the hip songs, but Spotify does not provide him the suggestion right away to that new (Beyoncé) song.

Aditya
* John tries using the product for his first time and he’s likes the fact that the application is completely free, easy to use, and there are no ads like Spotify. He also doesn’t have a hard time because the UI is clean and fairly straightforward. He doesn’t need to sign up or enter any user information to use the product. The search is fast and the recommendations are good.

Parsa
* Dan smith, 36, highschool basketball coach. He want to find new songs to play before games to hype up / get his players in the right mindset. His main motive is that he doesn’t want his playlist to get stale.


## Potential Features
* Have recommendation based on your playlist rather than all of your songs (discover weekly on Spotify)
* Have individual traits of a song such as (loudness, beats) you can drag a slider and based on those metrics it will recommend you the song. Such as (techHouse, RetroHouse)
* Characteristics of the song you can individually type in text such as “base heavy” and give you recommendations based on that
* Having recommendations where you can choose songs based on regions of the world so we can have songs which are more culturally diverse. For example: “Latin American music” could be a tag and we can search
