| Anmol       | Most code contributions were backend. Focused on implementing the base model for Rekofy by providing a simple drop-in wrapper for the Spotify API getRecommendations endpoint and also pushed for the development of a feature called SimilaritySearch from end-to-end. Pushed through several errors caught during debugging with Parsa. Focused on setting up a centralized directory of tests in the backend of the application meant to test any python file in any subdirectory of the backend and data directories. |
| Mauricio    | All code contributions were to the frontend only. Implemented Spotify Login Process to get access to user information. Created Rekofy logo that is displayed on navigation bar. Created the initial React website that the project was built off including the initial search bar |
| Ian         | Did a mix of both frontend and backend contributions, although most of them were frontend related. In the frontend, set up the navigation bar, search suggestions, filter popup/explicit filter/year filter, getting audio to play for each of the react cards, and the about page. Also set up deployment through Render. In the backend, I set up the flask app environment and handled the deployment of our backend on aws lambda. Also in general helped fix a few bugs in both the frontend/backend. |
| Francisco   | All code contributions were to the frontend only. Implemented Material UI with the suggestion from Aditya. Designed the cards for a simple UX and implemented said design with MUI. Built off of contributions from the team to get the frontend as clean and simple as possible. Tested and ran the project on multiple occasions to see if UX could be improved. Scribed three standups and led the team in our second retro. Suggested using spotify API for the project and found some necessary resources to help get our project started. |
| Aditya      | All coding contributions were to the backend only. Created flowchart and documented the original design for the recommendation engine. Researched into datasets and selected Kaggle Dataset for Rekofy. Configure backend Firebase database to store songs. Used SpotifyAPI to query songs based on name and artist. Developed recommendation engine using K-Means clustering algorithm (gets song data, clusters songs, performs PCA, gets mean vector) and connected it to the Flask endpoint. |
| Parsa       | Most code contributions were backend, some frontend. Focused on implementing the filter algorithms and setting up the corresponding MUI element for the filters in the frontend, using previously created filters as a template. Pushed through several debugging issues related to the debugging of the linking of the filters between the API endpoint and our modelâ€™s recommendations.|
