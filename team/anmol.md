Project:
	- Music Recommendation
Ideas:
	- react-web application providing simple UI for music selection based on preferences
	- simple machine learning model that will provide recommendations based on history
	- intuitive and well-documented code so anyone can pick up this project
	- small pull request-code reviews
	- perhaps a shazam feature
	- use publicly-available spotify dataset to train small and portable model
	- distributed computing to handle lots of users
