# Team Agreements

1. When one of us is absent for an unavoidable reason, we will let the other team members know on the team slack channel, in advance when possible, and as soon as possible afterwards when not
2. We will try to keep absences to a minimum.
3. Those of us that are present will do our best to share with the absent team members what they missed and help them get back up to speed
4. We will all do our best to contribute to the team's success
5. When out, we agree to put in our status update / daily scrum in the Slack so others know that we are still putting in effort
6. We all are responsible for each others' work. When someone is otherwise occupied with final exams and midterms for other classes that take up study time, they must ensure that the rest of the team knows to help pick up the slack when necessary
